# Twenty Questions

In twenty questions, a random individual -real or fictional -, - living or dead-, is randomly selected by the game. You, as the player, need to choose from a list of 
pre-determined properties and guess the individual by its results. After twenty questions are asked you lose, and the individual is revealed. Work out who they are 
before the twentieth question! ;)

Play this game by downloading the repository and running twenty_questions.py at your command line.
